# SynoPassthru
Many thanks to [@sramshaw](https://github.com/sramshaw) for the great ideas that inspired this fork.

Synology VMM is based on KVM, but it does not allow users to edit the config file manually. The only way (as I know) to passthrough a PCI device is by using "virsh attach-device", which is quite inconvenient since you have to do it every time you restart your virtual machine. Besides, some PCI devices must be attached at the very begining of the VM, manually attaching it may not always be successful.

Thus, SynoPassthru is a useful script that can automatically pass through PCI devices to a VMM virtual machine during boot-up.

## How To
#### 1. IOMMU support check

First, you need to verify if passthrough is supported on your platform. 
```
root@DSM7:~# dmesg | grep IOMMU
[   29.046464] pci 0000:00:00.2: AMD-Vi: IOMMU performance counters supported
[   31.780077] pci 0000:00:00.2: AMD-Vi: Found IOMMU cap 0x40
[   32.800487] perf/amd_iommu: Detected AMD IOMMU #0 (2 banks, 4 counters/bank).
[   33.636767] AMD-Vi: AMD IOMMUv2 driver by Joerg Roedel <jroedel@suse.de>
```
As shown in the example above, dmesg should display the IOMMU keyword, and the driver must be loaded without any error.  
_(Tips: If you're using XPEnology, switch to the SA6400 machine for better virtualization support)_


#### 2. IOMMU group check

The PCI device you want to passthrough must be in its own separate IOMMU group. You can use [iommu.sh](https://github.com/jcchen7566/SynoPassthru/blob/main/utils/iommu.sh) to check:
```

```
As shown above, I can passthrough "08:00.0 VGA compatible controller" because it is in its own IOMMU group. However, "05:00.0 Ethernet controller" cannot be passed through unless all devices in IOMMU Group 11 are passed through together.  

#### (Option) 3. IOMMU group aren't well-separated
You can try enabling the **ACS option** in the BIOS, this usually resolves the issue.  
  
But if you're using an AMD Zen 3 CPU with an older chipset (e.g. B350 or B450 motherboard), you may encounter an issue:  
_**The ACS option may be deprecated for newer CPUs due to BIOS storage limitations**_  
AM4 motherboards support up to five generations of CPUs (AMD YES!). To make this possible, some rarely used features had to be sacrificed. So if you unfortunately find that the ACS option is missing, downgrading the BIOS may help.  

Take me for example â€” I'm using AMD Ryzen 3 5350GE with an ASRock B450M Pro4 motherboard, and there's no ACS option in the BIOS. After doing some research online, I found this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/ASRock/comments/pfza16/deskmini_x300_bios_with_acs_enable/  
It mentioned that there's a BIOS version for Asrock B450F which supports well-separated IOMMU groups! After trying B450M BIOS with the same **AGESA version(1.2.0.6b)**, it works as well!  
_(Note: This BIOS version still doesn't include the ACS option, but it enables well-separated groups using the PCI ARI option instead.)_  

In conclusion, if you're using a different motherboard and run into the same issue, try flashing a BIOS with the same AGESA version above. If that still doesn't work... well, it's time to email the vendor and ask for itðŸ˜…
